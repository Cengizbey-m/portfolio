## Summary

Full-stack capstone app for next-day market insights: baseline ML predictions plus optional sentiment features, packaged into a UI that’s easy to explore.

## My contribution

- Owned evaluation approach (baselines + metrics) and translated results into clear UI-friendly outputs
- Defined the API contract between the backend and frontend
- Built features end-to-end (data → API → UI) and documented trade-offs for the team

## Tech snapshot

- Backend: FastAPI (Python) + SQLAlchemy
- Docker for local/dev setup
