# TheTripMan (Client)

**Live site:** https://www.thetripman.com

## Problem & users

The client needed a fast, mobile-friendly website that converts visitors into bookings/leads without exposing operational details. Users are customers looking for transportation services and a simple way to request availability and pricing.

## My role & responsibilities

- Full‑stack implementation and delivery (UI + integration patterns)
- Defined safe, public demo boundaries (dummy data, no secrets)
- Deployment setup and production hardening checklist
- Security/privacy constraints for a paying client project

## Key features

- Service catalog + conversion-focused landing sections
- Booking/request flow with validation and clear confirmation states
- Admin-friendly content updates (copy, pricing notes, contact routing)
- Accessibility and performance basics (fast LCP, predictable layout)

## Tech stack

- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- Hosting: Vercel (prod) / preview deploys

## Architecture (high level)

```

## Security & privacy considerations

**Confidentiality:** production code remains private. This case study focuses on architecture decisions and delivery work without exposing business-sensitive details.

- No client credentials in the repo (use environment variables)
- Least-privilege access for any admin endpoints
- Basic abuse controls (rate limit, bot mitigation where appropriate)
- Avoid exposing internal identifiers or operational data in the UI

## Deployment pipeline (CI/CD + hosting)

- PRs: Vercel preview deploy for quick review
- Main branch: production deployment after checks
- Quality gates (recommended): typecheck, lint, basic smoke test

## Database / data layer

Production can use Postgres (Neon/Supabase) for:

- booking requests (status, timestamps, service type)
- audit trail of contact submissions
- admin content metadata (optional)

## Challenges & what I learned

- Designing a public demo that proves engineering without violating confidentiality
- Keeping the UI conversion-focused while maintaining clean structure and performance

## Next steps

- Add automated end-to-end checks for the booking flow
- Add operational visibility (error monitoring + simple dashboards)
- Track conversion/lead metrics to quantify impact over time
