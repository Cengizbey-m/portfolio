# Formally — Fitness + Personal Development Platform (Prototype)

## Problem & users

I’m building Formally as a future business idea. The prototype focuses on UI/UX flows for onboarding, habits, and “next action” clarity — without real user data.

## My role & responsibilities

- Product + engineering ownership (concept → flows → UI components)
- Designed a public prototype repo with fake data only
- Planned a production architecture that can scale (auth, data, payments)

## Key features (prototype)

- Onboarding flow with clear defaults
- Habit/task views optimized for “today”
- Mobile-friendly layout and reusable component patterns

## Tech stack

- Next.js + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- UI patterns that can evolve into a design system

## Architecture (planned)

```mermaid

  U[User] --> FE[Next.js App]
  FE --> AUTH[Auth (Clerk/NextAuth)]
  FE --> API[Server Actions / API]
  API --> DB[(Postgres: Supabase/Neon)]
  API --> PAY[Payments (Stripe)]
  API --> OBJ[(Object Storage)]
```

## Security & privacy considerations

- Authentication + authorization boundaries (roles, ownership)
- Minimal data retention; clear user controls
- Secure payments (Stripe hosted checkout)

## Deployment pipeline (CI/CD + hosting)

- Vercel preview deploys for rapid iteration
- Production deploy gated on checks (lint/typecheck)

## Database / data layer

Planned Postgres entities:

- users, profiles
- habits, check-ins, streaks
- plans/programs, progress

Prototype uses **fake data only**.

## Challenges & what I learned

- Designing “simple” UX requires ruthless scope control
- Build components so they can scale into a real product later

## Next steps

- Usability testing (5–10 users) and iterate
- Add auth + real persistence behind feature flags
- Add basic telemetry to measure drop‑off (privacy-respecting)
